### The interesting analogy about Investment Bankers(Brian EdChesare)

First, you have to watch Entourage before you read this. 

IB don't create anything and we don't buy anything. we just sell things that aren't ours to begin with. 

If the business world were like Entourage, Investment bankers are agents, just like Ari. Private Equity firms and large companies would be the studios and companies would be the actors and movies. 

PE buy and sell companies; studios buy and sell actors and movies. Bankers make introductions and try to sell companies; agents make introductions and sell their clients(actors).
