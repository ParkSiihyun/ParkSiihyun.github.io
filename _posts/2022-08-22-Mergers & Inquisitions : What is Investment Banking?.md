# Summary of Mergers & Inquisitions

### what is Investment Banking? 

**Definition of Investment Banking:** Investment Banking is a segment(부분) of the financial services industry that assists companies, institutions, and governments with raising capital (underwriting) via Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and executing(수행하다) transactions such as [mergers and acquisitions (M&A)](https://mergersandinquisitions.com/ma-investment-banking/). 

Investment banks may also provide related services such as market-making and securities trading for both [equities](https://mergersandinquisitions.com/equity-trading/) (i.e., stocks and their derivatives, such as options) and [fixed income](https://mergersandinquisitions.com/fixed-income-trading/), also known as FICC (fixed income, currencies, and commodities).



### The interesting analogy about Investment Bankers(Brian EdChesare)

First, you have to watch Entourage before you read this. 

IB don't create anything and we don't buy anything. we just sell things that aren't ours to begin with. 

If the business world were like Entourage, Investment bankers are agents, just like Ari. Private Equity firms and large companies would be the studios and companies would be the actors and movies. 

PE buy and sell companies; studios buy and sell actors and movies. Bankers make introductions and try to sell companies; agents make introductions and sell their clients(actors).



### Networking

#### what is investment Banking networking? 

It’s the process of finding, contacting, and speaking with investment banking professionals to build relationships, gain knowledge, and eventually win interviews and job offers via those relationships.

Put simply, networking is the **best way to tip the odds in your favor** when you apply for internships and full-time jobs.

It allows you to build **personal relationships** with bankers so that they know you as more than “3.5 GPA, decent internships, and mid-tier private university” when they review your application and see your resume or CV.

And if you’re a career changer or you do *not* attend a top university or business school, networking is your only chance to break into the finance industry.

With networking, there are three main strategies: **1) Conducting informational interviews**, where you build connections with bankers over time; **2) Cold emailing**, where you directly ask about open positions; and **3) Cold calling**, where you do the same thing but on the phone instead.

* An **Informational Interview** (also known as an **informational meeting**, **coffee chat**, or more generically, **networking**) is a conversation in which a person seeks insights on a career path, an industry, a company and/or general career advice from someone with experience and knowledge in the areas of interest. Informational interviews are often casual and candid conversations where both parties are focused simply on acquiring and sharing knowledge. They can also be formal if the knowledge seeker is a job seeker and the knowledge provider is a potential employer whose goal is not only to provide information to the job seeker, but also to learn about the job seeker and judge their professional potential and corporate fit.
* 사실 우리나라에는 정보 인터뷰(인포메이셔널 인터뷰)라는 문화가 미국만큼 정착되지는 않은 것 같다. 정보 인터뷰는 크게 두가지 의미를 가지는데 첫번째로 구직자가 관심있는 분야의 종사자를 찾아 약속을 잡고 인터뷰를 하는 것이다. 두번째는 다른 부서로 이동하고 싶을 때 원하는 팀에 대한 이야기도 듣고 본인을 어필할 수 있는 기회라는 뜻이다. 넷플릭스 드라마 더 볼드 타입에서 더 자세히 그 문화를 알아갈 수 있다. 참고해보자.

* A **cold email** is an [unsolicited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolicited_electronic_communications) [e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail) that is sent to a receiver without prior contact. It could also be defined as the email equivalent of [cold calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling). Cold emailing is a subset of [email marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_marketing) and differs from transactional and warm emailing. Cold email, according to its proponents, is not [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming). However, if certain steps are not followed, it may be treated as spam by [spam filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering) or reported by the recipients. Cold email is a [personalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising), one-to-one message targeted at a specific individual. Its aim is to get into a business conversation with that individual, rather than to promote a product or a service to the masses.

* 콜드 이메일은 협업하고 싶거나 구직하고 싶은 사람들이 개인에게 자신을 PR하는 이메일을 보내는 것이다. 하지만 형식과 내용이 중요하기 때문에 무작정 보내면 오히려 자신의 이미지에 해가 될 수도 있다.
