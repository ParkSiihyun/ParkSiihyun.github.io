### Networking

#### what is investment Banking networking? 

It’s the process of finding, contacting, and speaking with investment banking professionals to build relationships, gain knowledge, and eventually win interviews and job offers via those relationships.

Put simply, networking is the **best way to tip the odds in your favor** when you apply for internships and full-time jobs.

It allows you to build **personal relationships** with bankers so that they know you as more than “3.5 GPA, decent internships, and mid-tier private university” when they review your application and see your resume or CV.

And if you’re a career changer or you do *not* attend a top university or business school, networking is your only chance to break into the finance industry.

With networking, there are three main strategies: **1) Conducting informational interviews**, where you build connections with bankers over time; **2) Cold emailing**, where you directly ask about open positions; and **3) Cold calling**, where you do the same thing but on the phone instead.

* An **Informational Interview** (also known as an **informational meeting**, **coffee chat**, or more generically, **networking**) is a conversation in which a person seeks insights on a career path, an industry, a company and/or general career advice from someone with experience and knowledge in the areas of interest. Informational interviews are often casual and candid conversations where both parties are focused simply on acquiring and sharing knowledge. They can also be formal if the knowledge seeker is a job seeker and the knowledge provider is a potential employer whose goal is not only to provide information to the job seeker, but also to learn about the job seeker and judge their professional potential and corporate fit.

* A **cold email** is an [unsolicited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolicited_electronic_communications) [e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail) that is sent to a receiver without prior contact. It could also be defined as the email equivalent of [cold calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling). Cold emailing is a subset of [email marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_marketing) and differs from transactional and warm emailing.

  Cold email, according to its proponents, is not [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming). However, if certain steps are not followed, it may be treated as spam by [spam filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering) or reported by the recipients.

  Cold email is a [personalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising), one-to-one message targeted at a specific individual. Its aim is to get into a business conversation with that individual, rather than to promote a product or a service to the masses.
